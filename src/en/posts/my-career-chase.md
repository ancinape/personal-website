My plan since high school has been to apply myself to enough openings to be hired in the technology sector. This may be anywhere in private or public, local or international, profit or non-profit, as long as I got to do what I love. That plan never survived first contact. Since then, I have made many changes to how I apply myself, such as this blog.

My first resume was conventional. It was designed during a career fair at Yale University with advice from recruiters. The design was pragmatic and efficient, black text on white paper with my name emboldened at the top. My contact information and skills followed suit, with my work history covering the rest of my resume.

Although, this format works for most people, it did not stick out in the stack of “most people” resumes. Designers and artists often color their resumes to illustrate the applicant’s character. I learned even directors at Yale’s medical campus paint their resume and format it differently, to better showcase their history. The knowledge was given to me during a meeting with one such director who showed their 2-page resume, one version including a headshot and one without, for workplaces that censor identifiable information during their candidate screenings.

I did not know where to begin. What format should I use? What colors should there be? I did not have pen and paper lying about, so I drew a basic sketch/wireframe of my new design using Xournal+++. This was the same strategy I used when designing websites.

The design was inspired by vexillology. My belief was if the resume is designed like a flag, it would illustrate my hobby of flag making. A canton took up the top left, like a [flag’s canton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton_(flag)) with my full name and informal titles. My languages took up width towards the [fly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_vexillology#Flag_elements). I omitted my fluency with the Russian language as it was ambiguous mixed in with the programming languages. I kept my work history as the main attraction, summarizing all of my internships into one as I was recently hired. Additionally, the end of the resume would include my hobbies, such as vexillology. This design better featured my experience with programming.

There was a version of my resume with and without my headshot. The color scheme was generated from [Coolors](https://coolors.co). The colors had to be pastel as to be easy to read on a screen and when printed in greyscale.

There were notable issues with this design that came as a result of simplification. There was no contact or degree information. Each line had significant empty space between and to the right. Overall, each line was too long, causing the reader’s eyes to travel far across the page, at least according to the [Baynard Institute](https://baymard.com/blog/line-length-readability).

The biggest issue was the stigma of internships. They are often dismissed from counting as work experience. An intern’s role is rarely defined so my experience may seem arbitrary to a recruiter. Since [the average recruiter spends around 7.4 seconds looking at a resume](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ladders-updates-popular-recruiter-eye-tracking-study-with-new-key-insights-on-how-job-seekers-can-improve-their-resumes-300744217.html) , they could skip chunks of an application as soon as they read the word “Intern.” I took to Xournal++ and sketched a new resume design, one that would address these problems.

Technically, this is a wireframe, as I included a placeholder for the headshot. While there are many more lines to this design, the biggest change was the placement of work history at the bottom. My belief was if I introduced my work before my history of internships, it may dispel some of the stigma. Afterall, my work seems arbitrary in the context of my internships so I seperated them into the projects sections. I also added the frameworks sub-section under languages. Many job openings specifically required frameworks. For example, web development positions would mention React or Node.JS more often than pure JavaScript, if at all.

This is the final iteration of my resume. The color scheme is made up of primary colors, coincidently making up the [Pansexual flag’s colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pansexual_flag). The scheme was kept pastel for easier viewing on the screen and on greyscale paper. The term “frameworks” was changed to “used in” as to include tools like Unity. I removed my hobby of vexillology, as it was not that important, and upgraded my server administration as an on-going project. By keeping the resume project-focused, a recruiter would learn of my internships last, hopefully considering me for my skills first.
