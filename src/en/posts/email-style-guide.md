I follow a particular style when writing email messages in a professional setting. Like a style guide for a programming language, this article covers my personal style guide for writing email messages starting from the first line of a message.

## Subject

Although the subject is the first part of an email message, it should be written last. The subject is meant to identify the main idea of the message in a short phrase. The subject may be innaccurate if it is written before the body of the message.

It does not need to stand out unless it is urgent. If it is, avoid terms like “urgent” or “important,” it can seem rude. Expand the subject to include more of the main idea. If all other options are exhausted, add your project title, name, initials, or any other redundant identifier.

The subject should follow title case. The first letter of every word should be capitalized. Exceptions are words that are less than three letters (such as “an” and “to” in this article’s title). However, the first letter of the first word is always capitalized, even if it is less than three letters.

## Greeting

The greeting is the first line of the email body. Depending on the formality of the message, it can be “Dear < name >,” “Hello < name >,” “Hi < name >,” or “Yo.” In most cases, “Hello” is sufficient as it can be applied in formal or casual settings. In formal messages, especially ones that contain a request like job applications, “Dear” would be necessary. These greetings establish a tone for the incoming message. The right tone for the right situation can avoid disrespect and awkwardness.

If sending a reply message, such as in a thread, the greeting can be omitted. It is redundant to repeatedly greet before each message. A thread of email messages is like a conversation; people do not greet each other before every sentence. A single greeting in the first message can be enough. In some cases, such as replying to a thread after a long hiatus, a greeting can be used again to reestablish a tone that was previously lost.

A rule of thumb is to use similar greetings to the original message. If a sender writes a greeting with “Dear,” it is appropriate to re-use “Dear” or another formal greeting in one’s own message. If the sender greets with “Hi,” follow up with a similar greeting.
## Body
The body contains the majority of the message. It follows the conventional English grammar and structure. Otherwise, there are a couple of caveats.
Dividing ideas into different paragraphs is vital in the body. The message must be easy to digest for the reader. Otherwise, the reader may be put off and ignore it.
Depending on the relationship with the person, it can be better to stick with short bodies. When writing to an unfamiliar person, it is best to keep the message short, usually one to two paragraphs. As the thread develops, one could ease in the rest of their message. This avoids the situation where strangers are less inclined to respond to messages that contain a large amount of text. For individuals you are familiar with, such as coworkers, the body may be as long as one wishes.
## Closing
Closing should append the body of every message. Similar to the greeting, it must be capitalized and ended with a comma. It can differ depending on formality. One can stick with the flexible “Sincerely.” Other possibilities are “Thank you,” “Thanks,” “Regards,” and the rare “Yours truly.”
