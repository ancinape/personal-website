Ethics define work. Everyone operates by ethics, whether they be religious dogma or unspoken rules. Defined in this page are all of my ethics and how they apply to my work.

## Veganism
*To minimize suffering onto all living beings.*

My work should not contribute to the suffering or exploitation of other beings, including people.

## Antinatalism
*To oppose procreation.*

My work should not lead to births. To continue the abstinence from malevolence, bringing beings into existence should be avoided as to spare them from inevitable suffering. Rather, those that already exist should be supported by my work.

## Pacifism
*To oppose war, militaries, and violence.*

My work should not support institutions of military, war, riots, and other manifestations of violence. These institutions perpetuate the worst kinds of suffering. While my work may be unintentionally used by the institutions, they will not be designed for them.

## FOSS Advocacy
*To advocate for free (libre), open source software.*

My work should be FOSS as legally possible. For my work to be FOSS, it would need to hold a FOSS license and be written for modular use with other projects. Not all of my work may be FOSS, likely due to local rules, but each one should be made as FOSS with respect to local regulations and organizational policies.
