### WIP

**Hi.** I am Farid, a designer engrossed in DevOps, extended reality (XR), user experience (UX), and vexillology (study of flags). See [Work](/en/work/) for my previous work. If you wish to contact me, feel free to email or video call me using the information provided in [Contact](/en/contact/).

Sometimes, I write about my work in [Articles](/en/articles/).

Any programmer follows their code of ethics. As such, you can see my code of [Ethics](/en/ethics/).
